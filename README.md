# Linux-scripts
My linux scripts

These were tested on Ubuntu 20.04

# Use

You should put these in the /usr/bin directory and just run them using their names.
If you don't have one of the Python3 modules installed just look on the web how to install them.

# mapit

Just copy an address to the clipboard and calling this script will open google maps on Chrome and search that address.

# mouselocation

Run this script in the terminal to get live coordinates of your mouse on the screen. This script also takes 0 or 1 as argument.(Look in the comments to see)

0 - includes the monitor on top
1 - excludes the monitor on top

It is very particular. It works for a setup with 2 monitors one on top of the other, and the y-resolution of the monitor on the top should be 1080 in order for the 1 flag to display correctly the y coordinate.
